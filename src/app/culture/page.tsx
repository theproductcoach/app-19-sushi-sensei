          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Sushi&apos;s origins date back to Southeast Asia, where fish was
            fermented in rice to preserve it. This method spread to Japan around
            the 8th century. The modern form of sushi (nigiri-zushi) was
            invented in Edo (now Tokyo) around 1824 by Hanaya Yohei as a
            fast-food option for workers.

          <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
          <p>
            Sushi in Japan represents more than just foodâ€”it&apos;s an art form and
            cultural institution. Sushi chefs (itamae) train for years to master
            their craft, learning everything from knife skills to rice
            preparation. The preparation and presentation of sushi embodies many
            Japanese cultural values: precision, attention to detail, and
            respect for ingredients.

                Intimate establishments where customers sit at a counter and
                interact directly with the sushi chef. These restaurants often
                serve omakase (chef&apos;s choice) meals.

                past customers on a conveyor belt. These establishments are more
